      <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
      <p></p>
      On our site(s), there are pages where you will be requested to enter
      private information in order to receive specific benefits of information
      in response. This data may include your name, and email address If you are
      signing up to a paid service from us, we (or our payment provider) may
      additionally request your billing information, such as card details and
      billing address. We also may use cookies on our site(s) in order to track
      your particular ‘session’ on our site. This is not used for contextual
      advertising purposes and, in general, is not directly traceable to you. We
      use Google Analytics on some of our sites in order to track the number of
      visitors, how those visitors came to our site, and which pages those
      visitors visit on our site(s). This is all handled under Google’s privacy
      policy. What We Do With Your Information We may use your information in
      order to track your relationship with us and our site(s) as well as to
      send you emails about information you have requested or other information
      or promotions specifically relevant to Cooper Press and its activities.
      Essentially, your data will only be used for the specific purposes for
      which it was collected (as per the Data Protection Act 1998 (UK)). We may,
      occasionally, send surveys or even direct one-to-one mail in order to
      manage our customer service processes. We do NOT share your information
      with third parties, we do NOT share your email addresses with sponsors or
      any third parties, and we do NOT run exclusive ‘sponsored’ emails on
      behalf of third parties. We may, however, have sponsors or advertisers for
      emails you would otherwise be choosing to receive but will not send mails
      specifically for the purpose of advertising third parties or their
      products. Please note that we do not store credit/debit card numbers nor
      do we share customer details with any 3rd parties. Information will not be
      disclosed to other parties without the consent of the individual whom it
      is about, unless there is legislation or other overriding legitimate
      reason to share the information (for example, the prevention or detection
      of crime). Acquisition of Cooper Press Assets In the case that Cooper
      Press or its assets are acquired by another company, the privacy policies
      of those other companies will apply to the information referenced herein.
