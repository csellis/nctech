## [NC Tech Scene][nctech]


I noticed at the end of 2019 that it was difficult to find relevant information on tech in North Carolina. I was looking for actionable information because I wanted to make a career in software development. I had recently listened to Peter Cooper about how he founded Cooper Press, the purveyor of Javascript Weekly. I felt inspired.
